# Workflow: Creating a New Component

Follow this workflow when you need to build a new React component for SellSnap. It chains the relevant rules and skills together so you end up with something that fits the codebase.

## Before You Touch Any File

**Step 1. Check whether the component already exists.**

Search `components/` for anything with a similar name or purpose. If a similar component exists, the right move is almost always to extend it (add a variant, add a prop) rather than create a new one. Two slightly different `Button` components is the start of a mess.

**Step 2. Decide where it goes.**

- Primitive (Button, Input, Badge) → `components/ui/`
- Product domain (ProductCard, PriceTag) → `components/product/`
- Dashboard only (OrdersTable, ProductList) → `components/dashboard/`
- Composite used in multiple domains (EmptyState, PageHeader) → `components/shared/`
- Used exactly once in a page and complex → `app/.../_components/` alongside that page

**Step 3. Load the right context.**

Open and read these files in order:

1. `.agents/rules/design-system.md` — the tokens, spacing, typography, and component patterns.
2. `.agents/rules/code-style.md` — naming, file organization, TypeScript conventions.
3. `skills/component-builder/SKILL.md` — the component template and the variant patterns.

Do not skip these. They are short and they are the difference between a component that fits and one that does not.

## Build It

**Step 4. Create the file.**

Use the template from `skills/component-builder/SKILL.md`. The shape is:

```tsx
import { cn } from '@/lib/cn';

type ComponentNameProps = {
  // required props first
  // optional props after
  className?: string;
};

export function ComponentName({ /* ... */, className }: ComponentNameProps) {
  return (
    <div className={cn('base-classes-here', className)}>
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Step 5. Decide server vs. client.**

Default to a server component. Add `"use client"` only if the component actually needs state, effects, browser APIs, or real event handlers. If you are unsure, start without `"use client"` and let TypeScript tell you if you need it.

**Step 6. Style with design tokens.**

Tailwind classes, no inline styles, no custom CSS. Use token classes (`bg-brand`, `text-ink`, `text-ink-muted`, `bg-surface`). If you find yourself reaching for an arbitrary value like `text-[#5A6270]`, pause and check whether there is a token for it. There almost always is.

**Step 7. Handle variants with `cva` if needed.**

If the component has variants (sizes, colors, styles), use `class-variance-authority`. See the Button example in `skills/component-builder/SKILL.md`. Do not stack conditional class strings.

**Step 8. Wire accessibility.**

- Interactive elements get a visible focus state (`focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-brand`).
- Icon-only buttons get `aria-label`.
- Form inputs get associated labels.
- Images get `alt` text.

## Check Your Work

**Step 9. Manually verify.**

If it is a primitive, import it into `app/_dev/page.tsx` and render every variant, size, and state. View it at 360px viewport width in Chrome DevTools. Tab into it to check the focus state. Hover over it.

If it is a domain component, view it in the page that uses it. Resize to mobile. Check keyboard navigation.

**Step 10. Cross-check against the rules.**

Quick mental pass before committing:

- [ ] Named export, not default.
- [ ] `className` prop accepted and merged with `cn()`.
- [ ] No hardcoded colors or pixel values.
- [ ] No `any` types.
- [ ] No `"use client"` unless actually needed.
- [ ] Works on a 360px-wide screen.
- [ ] Focus state visible.
- [ ] No console.log left behind.

**Step 11. Commit.**

Descriptive commit message. If the component is non-trivial, mention the intended use case in the message body so future you or future agents know why it exists.

## When Things Go Wrong

If you are stuck on something that does not fit the design system, do not invent new tokens or patterns. Ask the developer. The whole point of a design system is that it does not grow unchecked.
